# Brain-2-Word
The current problem involves introducing a deep learning model that decodes brain activities in the form of fMRI scans into text. By using an autoencoder, the fMRI signals are reduced into a latent space which is then used as input to the decoder. Instead of using the decoder to predict words, can be done using sentence embeddings.
